# Soft Body Creatures Simulation

A real-time soft body creature simulation built in **plain JavaScript** using the **HTML Canvas API**.  
This project explores autonomous agent behavior, physics-inspired motion, and performance-aware rendering without external libraries.

---

## Overview

The plan is to create a simulation that models soft-bodied, autonomous creatures composed of interconnected nodes and constraints. Each creature exhibits lifelike motion by responding to internal forces, environmental boundaries, and simple state-driven behaviors.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of **simulation architecture**, **state management**, and **real-time rendering** using low-level web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML Canvas
- Vanilla HTML & CSS  
- No frameworks or external physics engines

---

## Key Features (Planned)

- Soft-body motion using node-and-constraint relationships  
- Finite State Machine (FSM)–driven agent behavior  
- Real-time rendering loop with performance awareness  
- Separation of concerns between simulation logic, rendering, and input  
- Autonomous movement and interaction within the canvas environment  

---

## Architecture Plan

- **Simulation Layer**  
  Handles physics updates, constraint resolution, and agent state transitions.

- **Rendering Layer**  
  Responsible for drawing creatures and environments efficiently to the canvas.

- **Behavior System**  
  Uses a finite state machine to manage agent behavior in a predictable and extensible way.

This separation made the system easier to debug, extend, and reason about as complexity increased.

## What I am Learning

- Designing simulations using data-oriented principles  
- Managing real-time update loops efficiently in JavaScript  
- Implementing finite state machines for autonomous agents  
- Structuring non-framework JavaScript projects for maintainability  
- Debugging and optimizing performance-sensitive code  

---

## Future Roadmap

- Collision interactions between creatures  
- User-controlled parameters (stiffness, speed)  
- More advanced behavior states (flocking, avoidance, attraction)  
- Visual debugging tools for constraints and forces

## Why This Project Matters

Rather than relying on libraries, this project focuses on **fundamentals**: how motion, behavior, and rendering work under the hood. It reflects my interest in understanding systems deeply and building maintainable, well-structured code from first principles.
